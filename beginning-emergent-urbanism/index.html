<li><a href="../2009/06/01/organization-and-intelligence/index">Systems of organization and hierarchy differ from intelligent systems. Organizations are means of acting at ever greater scale by propagating the commands of a single center of decision. Intelligent systems are means of achieving greater understanding than any single individual by leaving the centers of decision all over the territory, forming links between them to generate patterns at greater scale.</a> [Organization and intelligence]</li>
<li><a href="../2007/10/18/emerging-the-city/index">Because of its complexity, a fully-realized city can only be achieved through emergence. Modern urban planning has succeeded only in eliminating complexity, and leaving an unfulfilling city for us to live with.</a> [Emerging the city]</li>

<li><a href="../2007/10/18/the-mathematical-definition-of-a-city/index">In an emergent city, the social and economic relationships between places are irreducible, meaning that they cannot be grouped into separate sectors.</a> [The mathematical definition of a city]</li>
<li><a href="../2007/12/07/a-measure-of-urban-connection/index">The connectivity of a complex city is not only measured over long distances, but also in micro-distances by the average distance from doorway to doorway. A well-connected city minimizes the distance walking from one doorway to another, which shopping malls have succeeded at doing in modern sprawl.</a> [A measure of urban connection]</li>
<li><a href="../2008/04/15/the-movement-economies/index">Space syntax research has shown that complex urbanity is characterized by an economy of movement, where the act of circulating is optimized by complex hierarchies of land uses, sometimes even using traffic as a public spectacle.</a> [The movement economies]</li>
<li><a href="../2007/10/29/why-build-cities-anyway/index">People move to cities in order to enjoy a greater diversity of spaces than they would enjoy if they lived autonomously, enjoying a division of labor, but also a division of culture, and so bigger cities are more valuable for their greater diversity.</a> [Why build cities anyway?]</li>
<li><a href="../2008/06/11/the-collapse-of-rural-cities/index">Cities die by the disintegration of their relationship sets, and rural-urban (rurban) regions held together by automobiles are the most likely to unwind back to isolation without affordable fuel for motoring.</a> [The collapse of rural cities]</li>
<li><a href="../2008/01/23/the-marketplace-city/index">In large metropolitan areas, shopping areas can become so complex that they grow into a city of their own. Shopping areas that cannot handle economic chaos fail, while those who adapt creatively become emergent.</a> [The Marketplace City]</li>
<li><a href="../2008/09/14/the-emergent-dimension-or-why-new-urbanism-is-not-urbanism/index">Urban design and urbanism are different not in shape but in dimension. While urban design requires the control of a single developer or designer to achieve its intended effect, urbanism is the connection of multiple actors into a shared marketplace.</a> [The emergent dimension, or why New Urbanism is not urbanism]</li>
<li><a href="../2008/09/30/creating-the-emergent-dimension-or-learning-from-wikipedia/index">Web systems have employed the emergent dimension to invent new forms of virtual urbanism.

<li><a href="../2008/07/23/complex-geometry-and-structured-chaos-part-ii/index">Traditional buildings are fractal because their structure consists of nesting elementary geometric forms, solids and voids, that solve problems created by previous iterations in the design process. Reusing these nesting rules generates the global geometric order in a building, and can also work from one building to another.</a> [Complex geometry and structured chaos - Part II]</li>
<li><a href="../2009/06/21/the-genesis-of-complex-geometry/index">Fractals in nature, and in human artifacts, grow in response to self-adaptations. Objects generate extensions within their own geometry that maintains the original pattern, growing more parts and adding more refined actions, without making less complex aspects of themselves obsolete.</a> [The genesis of complex geometry]</li>
<li><a href="../2008/11/06/design-configuration-and-natural-form/index">Complex morphology can be separated into two different classes of information, configuration and design pattern.

<li><a href="../2008/12/21/decoding-paradise-the-emergent-form-of-mediterranean-towns/index">Mediterranean towns have similar morphology because they all share a building process that spread as a legal code in the early Byzantine Empire.

<li><a href="../2009/01/14/how-they-build-today-in-palestine/index">Developers in Palestine have abandoned the traditional building codes and are building colonies using the modern process that crudely imitates the morphology of traditional towns, towards no practical purpose.</a> [How they build today in Palestine]</li>

<li><a href="../2009/05/11/the-fundamentals-of-urban-complexity/index">Freedom to configure and adapt buildings in time and place is what gives cities their organic aspect, while the re-utilization of hierarchically-defined building processes turns the entire city into one fractal object.</a> [The Fundamentals of Urban Complexity]</li>

<li><a href="../2008/02/11/dying-in-dignity-berlin-and-the-american-city/index">Confusing cities with political systems has undermined the "great" American cities since the beginning, in the case of Detroit leading to its ruin, while the best realized city of the industrial age, Berlin, was understood as a public utility, and has thus survived unbelievable calamities.</a> [Dying in dignity - Berlin and the American city]</li>
<li><a href="../2009/07/12/the-cultivation-of-a-spontaneous-city/index">The production of a network infrastructure is the basis of any form of emergent urbanization. In spontaneous cities open land serves this purpose, and provides enormous open space from which buildings are subtracted, leaving an optimized fractal pattern of streets. In modern planning, the network structure is built using engineering methods due to the capital investment required.</a> [The Cultivation of a Spontaneous City]</li>
<li><a href="../2009/07/29/lake-country/index">Building cities is not a simple matter of regulation of the market, but of the deliberate production of a marketplace with the right capital investments at the right scale to support this marketplace.

<li><a href="../2008/11/30/producing-land-with-nested-markets/index">Each marketplace, based on the planning regulations in force and the capital investments in infrastructure made, ends up producing its own specific morphology.</a> [Producing land with nested markets]</li>
<li><a href="../2009/07/12/the-cultivation-of-a-spontaneous-city/index">Market participants empowered by a network structure generate and produce the actual nodes, buildings and spaces, that forms the city, based on their own appreciation of their personal context in the network.</a> [The Cultivation of a Spontaneous City]</li>
<li><a href="../2009/07/12/the-cultivation-of-a-spontaneous-city/index">The morphology of a marketplace can be made harmonious and fractal if all participants employ the same transformation rules, sometimes called a shape grammar, to generate their nodes. (This is true as much on websites as in traditional Mediterranean cities.)</a> [The Cultivation of a Spontaneous City]</li>
<li><a href="../2008/12/21/decoding-paradise-the-emergent-form-of-mediterranean-towns/index">The legal code of Mediterranean towns tells us that complex form depends on an information system that modern planning has been oblivious to, and thus unable to properly reproduce its complex morphology.</a> [Decoding paradise - the emergent form of Mediterranean towns]</li>
<li><a href="../2009/06/30/modeling-the-processes-of-urban-emergence/index">Fractals are made by processes that feed back on themselves, but these processes can be combined and joined together. Emergent urbanization consists of multiple processes; a place process where people simply settle open space, an enclosure process where property boundaries are defined, a subdivision process where properties are split, a grid process where places are connected to each other, and a metropolitan process where mass transportation makes vertical building possible.</a> [Modeling the processes of urban emergence]</li>
<li><a href="../2009/10/05/defining-a-new-traditional-urbanism/index">Traditional urbanization does not proceed linearly, but by randomly occupying patches of open space in a nested pattern, filling them in to tighten and interlace economic networks internal to the neighborhood.</a> [Defining a new traditional urbanism]</li>
<li><a href="../2009/01/06/regional-complexity-and-local-community/index">The scale of the marketplace affects how governance relates to its participants. In large metropolitan areas, large corporations are formed out of the mergers of many cities. This results in a loss of local identity. The adverse of megaregions is a failure to deal with scale issues by producing infrastructure at the regional scale, due to communities being too small. Large metropolitan areas have suffered</a><a href="../2009/01/06/regional-complexity-and-local-community/index"> this problem since their advent in the 19th century.</a> [Regional complexity and local community]</li>
<li><a href="../2009/02/16/the-complex-grid/index">Resolving the multiple scale problems of circulation and development requires adopting a complex grid planning system, where growth and infrastructure emerges into a fractal network of streets.</a> [The complex grid]</li>
<li><a href="../2009/01/06/regional-complexity-and-local-community/index">Because of the fractal impact of infrastructure, it makes sense to take a fractal view of regional governance, and to split up a metropolis into one large city with many autonomous cities within it, in the pattern of a Sierpinski carpet fractal, thus balancing out both regionalism and localism.</a> [Regional complexity and local community]</li>
<li><a href="../2009/01/06/regional-complexity-and-local-community/index">Governments which are supposed to determine the boundaries of cities can handle only so many communities before the task becomes too complex. Decentralization of community mergers and divisions will therefore create a market of cities (a market of marketplaces), and the fractal shape of the region should emerge naturally from this market.</a> [Regional complexity and local community]</li>
<li><a href="../2009/07/29/lake-country/index">A system of growth and decay is necessary to renew the life of incorporated cities, and so the application of emergent planning systems requires creating new cities, perhaps within the boundaries of old ones, instead of reforming the existing system.</a> [The rules for changing rules]</li>
<li><a href="../2009/07/08/make-little-plans/index">The American urban planning mantra, "make no little plans", by famous architect Daniel Burnham, has been an abject failure.

<li><a href="../2009/04/04/the-geometry-of-nowhere/index">Sprawl tends to have, despite the myth, less open space than older cities, as after all the space has been allocated to roads, parking and ornamental landscaping, there remains nowhere for people to simply stand and walk around.</a> [The geometry of nowhere]</li>
<li><a href="../2008/10/22/the-challenge-of-dense-sprawl/index">High-density sprawl can therefore be even more hostile than low-density sprawl, and increasing the density of sprawl without increasing economic complexity will make the situation worse.</a> [The challenge of dense sprawl]</li>
<li><a href="../2008/10/31/more-evidence-that-new-urbanism-is-really-dense-sprawl/index">New Urbanist developments, for this reason, have had the tendency to be even more car dependent than low-density areas, despite being built to encourage walking.</a> [More evidence that New Urbanism is really dense sprawl]</li>
<li><a href="../2007/11/30/how-is-a-subdivision-possible/index">The modern housing subdivision is the replacement for Le Corbusier's tower block in his radiant city system, and similarly functions as a single unemergent block, incapable of generating any of its own complexity.</a> [How is a subdivision possible?]</li>
<li><a href="../2007/11/30/how-is-a-subdivision-possible/index">Due to its large size, to make a housing subdivision economically viable an enormously oppressive planning system must ensure that any smaller project is impossible.</a> [How is a subdivision possible?]</li>
<li><a href="../2007/12/09/victims-of-the-subdivision/index">Because they are large monolithic objects, housing subdivisions expose their inhabitants to the economic risk that inhabitants of tower blocks are exposed to, and the failure of a subdivision can be just as devastating as a tower collapsing.</a> [Victims of the subdivision]</li>
<li><a href="../2008/12/12/fake-complexity-mixed-used-development/index">Mixed used development is only the imitation of a real marketplace, as a marketplace produces mixed uses from the specialization of its different members and their adaptation to each others' presence. Mixed used development requires the same investment risk as any form of sprawl.</a> [Fake Complexity - Mixed Used Development]</li>
<li><a href="../2009/03/13/a-cuter-form-of-sprawl/index">New Urbanist developments have been around long enough that their failures have become evident, and developers have given up on the complexities of the plan, demonstrating that complexity is the product of many market participants and can't be forced on a single one.</a> [A cuter form of sprawl]</li>
<li><a href="../2009/10/05/defining-a-new-traditional-urbanism/index">Attempts at traditional and neo-traditional urbanism in the last decade have focused on replacing the modern buildings with classical architecture, without re-evaluating the planning system. This has meant that none of the neotraditional projects have been truly traditional, and that extraordinary effort needs to be made to preserve traditional construction when a traditional marketplace would naturally employ it.</a> [Defining a new traditional urbanism]</li>
<li><a href="../2009/05/19/the-development-model-is-finished/index">Without massive subsidies from an expanding credit system, sprawl development is too costly to be sustainable.

<li>Chinese sprawl is today the largest, allowing the <a href="../2009/09/20/poundbury-in-china/index">speculative production of imitation English villages</a> [Poundbury in China], and, Le Corbusier's dream, <a href="../2009/11/12/an-empty-city-for-sale/index">a city for one million inhabitants</a> [An empty city for sale], with no internal marketplace process.</li>
<li><a href="../2008/06/15/the-emergence-of-a-sense-of-place/index">The historicity of a place is achieved not by architectural design, but by the fossilization of the lives of the people and societies that inhabited it and their customization of the built forms.</a> [The emergence of a sense of place]</li>
<li><a href="../2009/09/02/review-of-radiant-city/index">The sprawl system, once concerns such as social exclusion and architectural quality have been corrected, remains alienating for one fundamental reason: it excludes citizens from the marketplace, leaving them as nothing more empowered than consumers of community.</a> [Review of Radiant City]</li>
<li><a href="../2009/02/23/slumdog-urbanist/index">Slums build more attachment to place than modern developments with amenities because their building process has grown greater social and economic complexity.</a> [Slumdog Urbanist]</li>
<li><a href="../2009/04/26/squatter-urbanism-comes-to-america/index">The repressive nature of the sprawl planning system forces many people into poverty, and the gaps in a frail system eventually allow these people to spontaneously urbanize areas as shantytowns. The economic crisis is creating these in America.</a> [Squatter urbanism comes to America]</li>
<li><a href="../2009/06/16/dont-demolish-detroit/index">Modern planned cities may not grow emergently, but they die emergently, producing landscapes such as the fractal urban prairie of ruined Detroit.
